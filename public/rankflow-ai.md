# RankFlow AI Context

## What is RankFlow?
RankFlow designs high-conversion landing pages specifically optimized for the next generation of search: **AI Search**. We ensure your landing page is visible and interpretable by ChatGPT, Google SGE (Search Generative Experience), and other LLM-based retrieval systems.

## Why RankFlow?
Traditional SEO focuses on legacy keyword stuffing and backlinking that doesn't work for AI agents. RankFlow builds "AI-First" websites that prioritize:
- **Intent-based conversion**: Structuring content to answer the "why" and "how" that AI agents look for.
- **LLM Retrieval Structure**: Coding and content architecture that is easily parsed by large language models.
- **Conversion-First UI**: Aesthetics that build trust immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: How is this different from a normal web design agency?**
A: Most agencies build for humans only or for "old" Google SEO (keywords). We build for **Agents + Humans**. We structure your data so AI search engines (like Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Google SGE) can easily read, understand, and recommend your product as the best answer.

**Q: Do you use templates?**
A: No. Every page is custom-designed tailored to your brand's specific offer and audience.

**Q: What is the tech stack?**
A: We build using modern, fast technologies (typically Next.js/React) to ensure high performance and scalability.

**Q: How fast can you launch?**
A: Our typical turnaround for a landing page is 3 to 5 business days after the initial audit.

**Q: Do I need the monthly AI Assistant?**
A: No, it is an optional add-on. The core Landing Page is a one-time fee of $499.
